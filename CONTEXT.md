## Glossary — Domain modules and seams

### Dispatch Pipeline Module
Module that composes Dispatch Policy Module, Query Execution Policy Module, and per-stage handlers (input-validation, plan, execution, result-builder, formatting, error-mapping, observability) into the end-to-end pipeline that produces a `QueryDispatchResult`. Entry point: `sdk/src/query/query-dispatch.ts`. Typed contract: `sdk/src/query/query-dispatch-contract.ts`.

### Dispatch Policy Module
Module owning dispatch error mapping, fallback policy, timeout classification, and CLI exit mapping contract.

Canonical error kind set:
- `unknown_command`
- `native_failure`
- `native_timeout`
- `fallback_failure`
- `validation_error`
- `internal_error`

### Sync Runtime Bridge Module
SDK Module exposing `executeForCjs(input: RuntimeBridgeExecuteInput): RuntimeBridgeSyncResult` — a synchronous-friendly entry point on top of the async `QueryRuntimeBridge`. Enables the CJS dispatcher (`bin/gsd-tools.cjs` and per-family `*-command-router.cjs` files) to invoke SDK query handlers in-process — no subprocess hop — while preserving the synchronous contract that ~21 CJS test files and 100+ consumers depend on. Implementation uses `synckit` (Atomics.wait on a SharedArrayBuffer in a pooled Worker thread). First-call cost ~80ms (Worker startup + native bridge construction); steady-state ~0.1ms per call after the worker warms. Maps the async bridge's exceptions into a typed sync result `{ ok: true, data, exitCode: 0 } | { ok: false, exitCode, errorKind, errorDetails?, stderrLines }` aligned with the Dispatch Policy Module's error taxonomy from ADR-0001 (`unknown_command`, `native_failure`, `native_timeout`, `fallback_failure`, `validation_error`, `internal_error`). Subprocess fallback is disabled by design inside the sync bridge — unknown commands surface as `unknown_command` rather than spawning `gsd-sdk`. Source: `sdk/src/runtime-bridge-sync/index.ts` + `sdk/src/runtime-bridge-sync/worker.ts`.

### Command Definition Module
Canonical command metadata Interface powering alias, catalog, and semantics generation.

### Query Runtime Context Module
Module owning query-time context resolution for `projectDir` and `ws`, including precedence and validation policy used by query adapters.

### Native Dispatch Adapter Module
Adapter Module that satisfies native query dispatch at the Dispatch Policy seam, so policy modules consume a focused dispatch Interface instead of closure-wired call sites.

### Query CLI Output Module
Module owning projection from dispatch results/errors to CLI `{ exitCode, stdoutChunks, stderrLines }` output contract.

### STATE.md Document Module
Shared CJS/SDK pure transform Module owning STATE.md parse, field extraction, field replacement, status normalization, and frontmatter reconstruction. It does not scan `.planning/phases` and does not own persistence or locking; phase/plan/summary counts arrive from inventory/progress Modules as inputs, and CJS/SDK read-modify-write paths remain Adapters. Source of truth: `sdk/src/query/state-document.ts`; CJS callers consume the generator-emitted `get-shit-done/bin/lib/state-document.generated.cjs` via the thin re-export at `get-shit-done/bin/lib/state-document.cjs`.

### Query Execution Policy Module
Module owning query transport routing policy projection (`preferNative`, fallback policy, workstream subprocess forcing) at execution seam.

### Query Subprocess Adapter Module
Adapter Module owning subprocess execution contract for query commands (JSON/raw invocation, `@file:` indirection parsing, timeout/exit error projection).

### Query Command Resolution Module
Canonical command normalization and resolution Interface (`query-command-resolution-strategy`) used by internal query/transport paths after dead-wrapper convergence.

### Command Topology Module
Module owning command resolution, policy projection (`mutation`, `output_mode`), unknown-command diagnosis, and handler Adapter binding at one seam for query dispatch.

### CJS Command Router Adapter Module
Compatibility Adapter Module for `gsd-tools.cjs` command families. Uses generated command metadata plus small argument shapers to route to CJS handlers, rather than calling SDK Command Topology directly. Preserves CJS compatibility startup while reducing hand-written router drift. Per-family migration to call the **Sync Runtime Bridge Module**'s `executeForCjs` in-process — eliminating the remaining parallel CJS handler implementations — is the active work of #3524 Phase 5; the primitive itself ships in #3555, with each canonical command family (`state.*`, `verify.*`, `init.*`, `phase.*`, `phases.*`, `validate.*`, `roadmap.*`, `frontmatter.*`, `config.*`) routing through `executeForCjs` in its own follow-up enhancement.

### Query Pre-Project Config Policy Module
Module policy that defines query-time behavior when `.planning/config.json` is absent: use built-in defaults for parity-sensitive query Interfaces, and emit parity-aligned empty model ids for pre-project model resolution surfaces.

### Configuration Module
Shared CJS/SDK Module owning config load, legacy-key normalization, defaults merge, and explicit on-disk migration for `.planning/config.json`. Interface: `loadConfig(cwd) → MergedConfig` (pure read, never writes disk), `normalizeLegacyKeys(parsed) → { parsed, normalizations[] }` (idempotent, pure, returns the list of normalizations applied), `mergeDefaults(parsed) → MergedConfig` (deep-merge of parsed config over canonical defaults), `migrateOnDisk(cwd) → MigrationReport` (explicit, opt-in, called by the installer and by `gsd-tools migrate-config`). Invariants: never mutates disk inside `loadConfig`; legacy top-level keys (`branching_strategy`, `sub_repos`, `multiRepo`, `depth`) are normalized into their canonical nested locations in the returned value; defaults come from the shared `sdk/shared/config-defaults.manifest.json`; schema (`VALID_CONFIG_KEYS`, `RUNTIME_STATE_KEYS`, `DYNAMIC_KEY_PATTERNS`) comes from `sdk/shared/config-schema.manifest.json`. Source of truth: `sdk/src/configuration/index.ts`; CJS callers consume the generator-emitted `get-shit-done/bin/lib/configuration.generated.cjs` via the thin Adapters at `bin/lib/core.cjs:loadConfig` and `bin/lib/config-schema.cjs`. Eliminates the recurring #3523-class drift bug structurally.

### Planning Workspace Module
Module owning `.planning` path resolution, active workstream pointer policy (`session-scoped > shared`), pointer self-heal behavior, and planning lock semantics for workstream-aware execution.

### Workstream Inventory Module
Shared CJS/SDK Module owning workstream directory discovery, per-workstream state projection, phase/plan/summary counting, roadmap-declared phase count, active marker projection, and active-workstream collision inputs. Command handlers render list/status/progress outputs from this inventory instead of rescanning `.planning/workstreams/*` directly. Source of truth for the pure projection is `sdk/src/workstream-inventory/builder.ts` (a Builder Module emitted to `get-shit-done/bin/lib/workstream-inventory-builder.generated.cjs` via the generator pattern); per-side Reader Adapters (`bin/lib/workstream-inventory.cjs` sync, `sdk/src/query/workstream-inventory.ts` async-ready) collect filesystem inputs and delegate projection to the Builder.

### Project-Root Resolution Module
Shared CJS/SDK Module owning project-root resolution from any starting directory. Walks the ancestor chain (bounded by `FIND_PROJECT_ROOT_MAX_DEPTH = 10`) applying four heuristics in order: (0) own `.planning/` guard (#1362), (1) parent `.planning/config.json` `sub_repos` traversal, (2) legacy `multiRepo: true` boolean + ancestor `.git`, (3) `.git` heuristic with parent `.planning/`. Returns `startDir` when no ancestor qualifies. Sync `node:fs` I/O. Source of truth: `sdk/src/project-root/index.ts`; CJS callers consume the generator-emitted `get-shit-done/bin/lib/project-root.generated.cjs` via thin re-exports at `get-shit-done/bin/lib/core.cjs` and `sdk/src/query/helpers.ts`.

### Planning Path Projection Module
SDK query Module owning projection from project/workstream context to concrete `.planning` paths. Policy precedence is `explicit workstream > env workstream > env project > root`. Invalid workspace context is a validation error at this seam rather than a silent fallback.

### Worktree Root Resolution Adapter Module
Adapter Module owning linked-worktree root mapping and metadata-prune policy (`git worktree prune` non-destructive default) for planning/workstream callers.

### SDK Package Seam Module
Module owning SDK-to-`get-shit-done-cc` compatibility policy: legacy asset discovery, install-layout probing, transition-only error messaging, and thin Adapter access for CJS-era assets that native SDK Modules have not replaced yet.

### Runtime-Global Skills Policy Module
Module owning runtime-aware global skills directory policy for SDK query surfaces. Resolves runtime-global skills bases/skill paths from runtime + env precedence, renders display paths for warnings/manifests, and reports unsupported runtimes with no skills directory.

### Installer Migration Authoring Guard Module
Module owning validation for Installer Migration Module records and planned actions. It enforces migration metadata, explicit install scopes, ownership evidence for destructive/config actions, and runtime contract citations for runtime config rewrites before a migration can enter planning or apply.

### Skill Surface Budget Module
Module owning which skills and agents are written to runtime config directories at install time (Phase 1) and at runtime via cluster-level toggles (Phase 2). Phase 1: `get-shit-done/bin/lib/install-profiles.cjs` defines named profiles (`core`, `standard`, `full`), computes transitive closure over `requires:` frontmatter, stages skills/agents to runtime config dirs, and persists the chosen profile in a `.gsd-profile` marker. Profile resolution precedence: explicit `--profile=` flag > `.gsd-profile` marker > `full`. `--minimal`/`--core-only` are back-compat aliases for `--profile=core`. Phase 2: `get-shit-done/bin/lib/surface.cjs` implements the `/gsd:surface` slash command for cluster-level enable/disable without reinstall; cluster definitions live in `get-shit-done/bin/lib/clusters.cjs`; per-runtime state persists in `<runtimeConfigDir>/.gsd-surface.json` independent from the `.gsd-profile` marker. See ADR-0011.

### Runtime Artifact Layout Module
Module owning the per-runtime mapping from artifact kind to filesystem placement. ADR-3660 defines the typed `kinds` per runtime (`commands`, `agents`, `skills`) with destination subpath, prefix, and stage adapter (with per-runtime converters in `bin/install.js`: `convertClaudeCommandToClaudeSkill`, `…CodexSkill`, `…CopilotSkill`, `…AntigravitySkill`). Phase 1 applies this seam to the Runtime Surface Module (`surface.cjs:applySurface`). Phase 2 is planned to migrate install/uninstall in `bin/install.js` so all lifecycle sites iterate one shared layout table instead of re-encoding runtime layout logic. This design is intended to remove the #3659 class of omissions. Migrations remain under the Installer Migration Module (ADR-0008). See ADR-3660.

### MVP Mode
Phase-level planning mode that frames work as a vertical slice (UI → API → DB) of one user-visible capability instead of horizontal layers. Resolved at workflow init via the precedence chain: `--mvp` CLI flag → ROADMAP.md `**Mode:** mvp` field → `workflow.mvp_mode` config → false. All-or-nothing per phase (PRD #2826 Q1). Surfaced as `MVP_MODE=true|false` to the planner, executor, verifier, and discovery surfaces (progress, stats, graphify). Canonical parser: `roadmap.cjs` `**Mode:**` field; canonical resolution chain documented in `workflows/plan-phase.md`. Concept index: `references/mvp-concepts.md`.

### User Story
Phase-goal format under MVP Mode: `As a [role], I want to [capability], so that [outcome].` Required regex shape: `/^As a .+, I want to .+, so that .+\.$/`. Used as the framing input by `gsd-planner` (emits as bolded `## Phase Goal` header in PLAN.md) and as the verification target by `gsd-verifier` (the `[outcome]` clause is the goal-backward verification anchor). Authored interactively by `/gsd-mvp-phase`, validated by SPIDR Splitting when too large.

### Walking Skeleton
Phase 1 deliverable under `--mvp` on a new project: the thinnest end-to-end stack proving every layer (framework, DB, routing, deployment) works together. Emitted as `SKELETON.md` capturing the architectural decisions subsequent vertical slices inherit. Gate fires when `phase_number == "01"` AND `prior_summaries == 0` AND `MVP_MODE=true`. Scope intentionally narrow (PRD #2826 Q2) — does not retrofit existing projects.

### Vertical Slice
Single-feature task that moves one user capability from open-to-close (happy path) end-to-end. Contrast with the horizontal layer (all models, then all APIs, then all UI). The MVP Mode planning unit; SPIDR Splitting axes (Spike, Paths, Interfaces, Data, Rules) are the canonical decomposition tools when a slice is too large for one phase.

### Behavior-Adding Task
Predicate over a PLAN.md task: `tdd="true"` frontmatter AND `<behavior>` block names a user-visible outcome AND `<files>` includes at least one non-`*.md` / non-`*.json` / non-`*.test.*` source file. Pure doc/config/test-only tasks are exempt. The MVP+TDD Gate (in `references/execute-mvp-tdd.md`) only halts execution on this predicate; the gsd-executor agent applies all three checks at runtime. Currently a prose-only specification — no shared utility.

### MVP+TDD Gate
Per-task runtime gate in `/gsd-execute-phase` that, when both `MVP_MODE` and `TDD_MODE` are true, refuses to advance a Behavior-Adding Task until a failing-test commit (`test({phase}-{plan})`) exists for it. The `tdd_review_checkpoint` end-of-phase review escalates from advisory to blocking under the same condition. Documented contract: `references/execute-mvp-tdd.md`. Reserved escape hatch `--force-mvp-gate` is documented but not implemented.

### SPIDR Splitting
Five-axis story decomposition discipline (**S**pike, **P**aths, **I**nterfaces, **D**ata, **R**ules) used by `/gsd-mvp-phase` when a User Story is too large for one phase. Full interactive flow per PRD #2826 Q3 (not a lightweight filter). Reference: `get-shit-done/references/spidr-splitting.md`.

## Test rules and lint

`RULESET.TESTS.no-source-grep=scripts/lint-no-source-grep.cjs rejects readFileSync source + .includes()/.match()/.startsWith() on the bound var; CI hard-fail`
`RULESET.TESTS.no-source-grep.stdout-extension=also flags assert.match/doesNotMatch on .stdout/.stderr — emit JSON from SUT, parse, assert on typed fields`
`RULESET.TESTS.no-source-grep.exemption=// allow-test-rule: <runtime-contract-is-the-product> with one-line justification; reserved for tests where the file content IS the product surface (STATE.md, config.toml, hooks.json, agent .md). Migration to typed-IR parser tracked in #2974.`
`RULESET.TESTS.no-source-grep.tmp-file-traps=reading tmp files written by the SUT in tests still trips lint; round-trip through CLI (e.g. frontmatter get) instead of readFileSync+.includes()`

`RULESET.TESTS.escape-regex=new RegExp("prefix${var}") must escapeRegex(var); core.cjs already exports escapeRegex; phase IDs like 5.1 contain . which is metacharacter`
`RULESET.TESTS.no-dead-regex-in-includes=src.includes("foo.*bar") is always false — .* is regex metacharacter not wildcard; use new RegExp(...).test(src) or delete`
`RULESET.TESTS.guard-toplevel-readFileSync=module-level const src = readFileSync(...) throws before any test() registers — wrap in try/catch in test() or use lazy load`
`RULESET.TESTS.coderabbit-fix-prefer=behavioral tests (call exported fn, capture JSON, assert typed fields) over source-grep`
`RULESET.TESTS.diagnostics=after JSON.parse, assert output shape (Array.isArray(output.phases)) with raw-output-prefix diagnostics before .map() — prevents opaque TypeErrors when CLI output shape changes`
`RULESET.TESTS.boundary-coverage=tests MUST exercise inputs at and near the threshold/limit, not only trivial-fit and trivial-overflow; pick inputs where N ∈ {limit-1, limit, limit+1} and where pre-trim/pre-check accumulators ≈ effective limit; "very small" and "very large" inputs alone do not constitute edge-case coverage and routinely miss off-by-one + reservation-accounting bugs`
`RULESET.TESTS.boundary-coverage.fixtures=for any code with budget/limit/quota/threshold parameter, test suite MUST include: (a) input where SUT estimate == limit exactly, (b) input where estimate == limit - 1, (c) input where estimate == limit + 1, (d) input where any internal reserve/safety constant pushes baseline within reserve-distance of limit (catches early-pressure firing)`
`RULESET.TESTS.boundary-coverage.anti-pattern=test suites that pair budget:1_000_000 (trivially fits) with budget:1 (trivially overflows) and skip the boundary region; failure mode that shipped PR #3708 UNNEEDED_TRIM + FALSE_HARDFAIL regressions (commit 2df566ed, fixed bde1ae8f)`
`LEARNING.prompt-budget.boundary-gap=PR #3708 commit 2df566ed reserved NOTE_RESERVE_TOKENS in pressure-threshold AND in minSet pre-check; both buggy paths only fire when baseTokens ∈ (effectiveBudget - NOTE_RESERVE_TOKENS, effectiveBudget]; original test suite used budgets far from that band so neither path was exercised; fix bde1ae8f confines NOTE_RESERVE accounting to post-trim assembly path only; future budget/limit code MUST add boundary fixtures per RULESET.TESTS.boundary-coverage.fixtures`

`RULESET.WORKFLOW_MARKDOWN.FENCES=preserve opening language fence when editing shell snippets in workflow markdown; malformed fence creates fresh CR threads (MD040)`
`RULESET.WORKFLOW_SIZE_BUDGET=workflow-size-budget can fail otherwise-valid review fixes; XL workflows <=1800 lines or trim prose before final checks`
`RULESET.WORKFLOW_FILE_NAMES=workflow files use hyphens; <step name="..."> XML attributes must match (extract-learnings not extract_learnings); tests should pin exact hyphenated name`
`RULESET.WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_CONTEXT=@-ref in commands/gsd/*.md must resolve to an existing file on disk; regression test in tests/bug-3135-capture-backlog-workflow.test.cjs; INVENTORY.md row + INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json families.workflows must stay in sync; "Invoked by" attribution must move when a flag absorbs a micro-skill`
`RULESET.WORKFLOW_EXECUTE_END_TO_END=ADR-0002 standard for single-workflow commands is "Execute end-to-end." (no bolded **Follow the X workflow** fragments); flag-dispatch routing uses "execute the X workflow end-to-end." in routing bullets`

`RULESET.ALLOWED-TOOLS-FRONTMATTER=command's allowed-tools must cover every tool the workflow calls (including Write for file creation); thin-wrapper pattern makes this easy to miss`
`RULESET.ARGUMENTS-SANITIZE=any workflow step constructing .planning/.../{SLUG}.md path from user input ($ARGUMENTS, parsed remainder) must sanitize inline ([a-z0-9-] only, reject ..//\\, max-length) — "(already sanitized)" must trace back to explicit guard; RESUME/fallback modes need own guards`
`RULESET.SHARED-HELPERS-LINT-VS-TEST=when a lint script and test suite both implement same constant (CANONICAL_TOOLS) or parser (parseFrontmatter, executionContextRefs), extract to scripts/*-helpers.cjs required by both — silent divergence otherwise`

`RULESET.GEMINI.TOOLS.ask_user=Gemini CLI has no ask_user tool; filter both AskUserQuestion and lowercase ask_user from tools frontmatter and neutralize both names in body text`
`RULESET.GEMINI.TEST_SENTINEL=convertClaudeToGeminiAgent regression should assert tools excludes ask_user, body excludes AskUserQuestion/ask_user, and Read still maps to read_file`

`RULESET.ADR-HEADER=every docs/adr/NNNN-*.md must open with - **Status:** Accepted|Proposed|Deprecated + - **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD immediately after title`
`RULESET.MANIFEST-CANONICAL-KEY=docs/INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json — only families.workflows is canonical (read by tooling); top-level workflows key is stale, delete if present`

`RULESET.SDK-ONLY-VERBS.exemption=any gsd-sdk query verb implemented only in SDK native registry (no gsd-tools.cjs mirror) must be added to NO_CJS_SUBPROCESS_REASON in sdk/src/golden/golden-policy.ts — otherwise golden-policy test fails treating verb as missing implementation`

`RULESET.PR-SCOPE.one-concern-per-pr=split unrelated changes into separate PRs; cherry-pick doc changes to dedicated docs/ branch immediately, then force-push original to remove the commit`

`RULESET.TRIAGE-EXISTING-WORK=before writing agent brief for confirmed bug, check (1) local branches git branch -a | grep <issue>, (2) untracked/modified files on that branch, (3) stash, (4) open PRs with matching head branch — recover existing work rather than re-implement`

`RULESET.CR-THREAD-RESOLVE=after adding // allow-test-rule: to silence lint, resolve existing inline CR threads via graphql resolveReviewThread mutation before merge — open threads mislead future reviewers; pattern: gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"PRRT_..."}) { thread { isResolved } } }'`

`RULESET.DOC-CONSISTENCY=when heading says (N shipped) and footnote says N-1 top-level references, update both; CR catches every time`

`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.symptom=SDK port (sdk/src/query/*.ts) cites bin/lib/*.cjs source in docstring; CJS gets a fix or new constant; SDK lags silently`
`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.examples=#3317 (skills missing from SDK GSD_MANAGED_DIRS), #3240 (extractFrontmatter anchor), #3226 (phase.add --dry-run), #3243 (cjs dotted canonical), #3229 (model catalog source-of-truth)`

`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.anchor=tests/config-schema-sdk-parity.test.cjs is the canonical pattern — replicate per port-pair`

`DEFECT.REMOVED-BUT-NEEDED.symptom=file/key removed because "scoped under sdk/" or "no longer used" without verifying every consumer (workflows, docs, manifests, npm scripts)`
`DEFECT.REMOVED-BUT-NEEDED.examples=#3316 root package-lock.json (root package.json declares deps; workflows use cache:'npm' + npm ci), e3b52c70 docs referenced removed /gsd-new-workspace`

`DEFECT.PHASE-DIR-PREFIX-DRIFT.symptom=multiple workflow files independently construct .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug} paths; project_code prefix or slug normalization missing in some surfaces`

`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.examples=#3303 + #3307 superseded by #3306 (all addressing #3297/#3298 project_code prefix family)`
`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.detect=after a fix lands on main, grep recently-merged PR title for shared keyword/issue; check open PRs touching same files; if open PRs are subsets of merged work they are superseded`
`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.fix-forward=close superseded PRs via gh api PATCH state=closed; do not comment on self-authored PRs (k101); the link to the merged PR makes supersession discoverable in PR history`

## Shell Command Projection Module (expanded glossary entry, 2026-05-13)

Module owning all OS-facing I/O for the tool: runtime-aware command-text rendering (hook commands, PATH action lines, shim scripts), subprocess dispatch (run-git, run-npm, run-tool, probeTty), and platform file I/O (platformWriteSync, platformReadSync, platformEnsureDir). Single seam for platform-conditional logic — one place to fix any shell or file write regression across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Lives in `get-shit-done/bin/lib/shell-command-projection.cjs`. See ADR-0009 (superseded "does not execute" constraint) and ADR-0010 (superseded File Operation Engine).

Invariants:
- Result shape: all run-* return `{ exitCode, stdout, stderr }`; never throw on non-zero exit code.
- Platform policy owned at the seam: `shell: process.platform === 'win32'` lives only in run-npm; probeTty returns `null` on Windows.
- Normalization policy: platformWriteSync owns full `normalizeMd` for `.md`; CRLF-to-LF + trailing newline for all others; callers must NOT pre-call `normalizeMd`.
- `_normalizeMd` is re-implemented inline (not imported from `core.cjs`) to avoid circular dep.
- `atomicWriteFileSync`, `safeReadFile`, `normalizeMd` remain in `core.cjs` exports until Phase 4 (#3468).

Migration plan: Phase 1 (#3465) seam additions complete; Phase 2 (#3466) targets 6 subprocess files; Phase 3 (#3467) targets 15 fs files (215 call sites); Phase 4 (#3468) removes compat exports.
